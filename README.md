## Installation:
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Rkpani05/Customer-Churn-Prediction.git
   cd Customer-Churn-Prediction]
2. **Install Required Libraries:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
3. **Unzip Model Files:**
   ```bash
   unzip path_to_zipped_models.zip -d destination_folder/

## Usage:
1. **Run the Web Application:**
   ```bash
   python app.py
2. **Access the Application:**
  Open a web browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000 to access the application.

3. **Input Customer Data:**
  Use the web interface to input customer data and click on 'Predict' to get the churn prediction.

## Dataset:
  The dataset used for this project can be found in the same directory. It contains various customer attributes and their churn status.

## Model Information:
  The project utilizes optimized_rf for predicting customer churn. The trained model, along with preprocessing utilities, are stored as .pkl files in the 'pkl files/' directory.
